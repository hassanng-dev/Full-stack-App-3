I am very passionate about health and becoming the best version of yourself. I've learned throughout the years of working out that not only is it important to stay active to stay healthy, however healthy eating is very crucial in your journey. What I've created is a meal tracker where you can keep track of your daily meals and also have the ability to input macronutrients.

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.JS, Express, and MongoDB

How I built this project is using HTML and CSS for markup text and styling. I used Javascript for the logic of the project. I used Javascript to have the ability to sort each meal into days of the week. I also used Javascript to be able to delete items and and favorite your meals throughout the day. In the back-end I used MongoDB to store any data I submitted to my database. Express was used to simplify the process of creating my database to store information. I was passionate about this project because I incorporate this project into my life to keep track of what I am eating on a daily and weekly basis.

LESSON LEARNED:

The lesson I learned is the process of using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to save information to my database. I learned more about Javascript and how powerful it is in the client and server side. I am excited to create more projects!
